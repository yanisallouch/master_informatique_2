Possible Questions in Exam 2:

1. Write database queries using the relational algebra (RA) or first-order (FO) queries.
2. Decide if two FO/RA queries are equivalent.
3. Translate an FO query into an RA query and vice-versa.
4. Describe the algorithm used to solve Boolean FO query entailment. Informally argue that this algorithm runs in polynomial time.
5. Argue that the problem of Boolean CQ entailment is in NP.
6. Check if a given CQ is acyclic. Present some algorithm that determines if a CQ is acyclic.
7. Discuss how to construct a join tree for an acyclic query.
8. Discuss the poly-time algorithm that solves acyclic Boolean CQ entailment.
9. Argue that the problems of query answering, query entailment, and query emptiness can be reduced to each other.
10. Decide if a CQ is subsumed or equivalent to another CQ.
11. Minimise a given Boolean CQ.
