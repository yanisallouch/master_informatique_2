The goal of a software engineer is to develop a software program that produces the desired results for customers on time and within budget. In order to improve software quality, high-risk components within the software project should be caught as early as possible. Early detection of problems enables software managers to make timely decisions and better planning of tight resources. We believe that machine learning techniques are well suited for defect identification and prediction in software projects. We propose a model that will help catch those problems earlier in the project life cycle.
